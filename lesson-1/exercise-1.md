## Exercise 1: Hello, TensorFlow!

As is customary, let's start with a basic "Hello, world!" example.

### Step 1:
Import tensorflow library.

### Step 2:
Create a constant tensorflow operation to store your "Hello, world!" string ([documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/constant_op/constant_value_tensors#constant)).

### Step 3:
Create a tensorflow session ([documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Session)).

### Step 4:
Run the session, passing it the constant as a fetch ([documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Session#run)).

### Step 5:
Use "with" statement (context management) to define session in your script ([documentation](http://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htm)). Re-run your script to make sure it still works.
